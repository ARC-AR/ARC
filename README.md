### _**Inspiration**_

Fashion as we know it has become obsolete. The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated how unsustainable the classic fashion business model is. With digital, nothing physical is ever needed, only data. Design can be distributed across a multitude of designs and people will be able to directly access and adopt the designs of those they prefer to patronize. Making a statement will become both more accessible and less impactful to the environment as when fashion changes the design can be changed without having to sent a garment to landfill.

As technology improves people will be able to display their fashion choices to others without having to worry about losing control of their design. Digital garment signatures could prove authenticity and protect copyright. Certificate authorities could be formed from fashion houses to lend their trusted brand to designers to form a curated digital range of fashion whose lineage can be traced and proved using some of the same methods used to verify the identity of websites we use to conduct our business every day online.

For now we have curated a digital gallery of fashion that can be viewed in concert with a gallery t-shirt. When perceiving the gallery through this filter different realities can be contemplated and a future of augmented fashion brought just a little closer.

We were inspired by Lego and how it has a system. Fashion needs a system. Fashion is one of the most polluting industries In the world. The rise of AR shows the promise of a digital-based design that doesn't create any waste or chemicals. Fashion needs to be shareable editable, so that the consumer is the designer and has full customization.

### _**What it does**_

Using marker recognition to place AR filters atop a t-shirt to give the wearer different options to be styled in without the need to buy anything physical. There are 10 filters to choose from that can be used on Facebook and Instagram.

Demo t-shirt with a logo that serves as a tracker for the filter. All art was made by Dries Bates.

### _**How we built it**_

Using hand-drawn illustrations and using Illustrator to create unique artwork, as well as using other AR tits to show the potential in a shared network.
How I built it

We created a logo to use as a tracking marker and then combined an UI picker to allow users to select to view different pieces of art in the effect. In total we have 10 different filters that will be applied to the garment according to the user's choice. Logic was used in the patch editor to enable animation for some pieces and also music where appropriate.

### _**Challenges we ran into**_

Learning how to use Spark AR. Our team members have very different backgrounds, with a member who's been working with AR previously but within the aerospace industry, a member who is a fashion designer and another member who is a frontend engineer. It was our first time using Spark AR and also the first time making filters for the general public on Facebook and Instagram, so we learnt a lot in the process.

### _**Accomplishments that we are proud of**_

Delivering on time working with a team formed only 3 days before, working remotely and the 3 of us being in different countries (United Kingdom & France).

### _**What we learned**_

We learnt how to use Spark AR. No member of the team had used it before the team was formed.

### _**What's next for ARC**_

We plan to use this to create a more advanced filtered garment with more customization so that the consumer is the designer.
